{\fad(500,0)}Don Chinjao

160
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,800
That was Conqueror's Haki!

161
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
No wonder.

162
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,890
He used to be a legendary pirate worth 500 million!

163
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:49,190
There is only one man that I want to fight, don't get in my way!

164
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,300
Thank you, Chinjao!
There are so many nice weapons to choose from now!

165
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,240
Whoa!

166
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,110
That man didn't get beaten by Don Chinjao's Haki

167
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,420
{\an8}And he's picking up weapons in the ring!

168
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,010
{\fad(500,0)}Bounty Hunter - Jean Ango
Jean the Bandit

169
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,010
{\an8}He is a dark horse in this competition, Jean the Bandit!

170
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:17,200
A bounty hunter that all big-time pirates in the New World hold a grudge against!

171
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,320
Wait, you shithead!

172
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,730
Now that I found you, your time is up!

173
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,080
I won't forgive you for sending my partner to prison!

174
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,880
My bullets are weapons I've picked up.

175
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,570
I'm a sniper!

176
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,300
If that partner guy was so important to you,

177
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,740
you should've shown spirit like you were raiding a prison! {Halee: Sounds weird in English, how about "you should have fought like you were raiding a prison!"}

178
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,660
There was an idiot like that two years ago.

179
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
Hey! That guy has already passed out!

180
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,990
How long will he keep punching him?!

181
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,860
Hey, stop, brother! He's already knocked out!

182
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,000
That's enough!

183
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:09,960
I restrained the wrong person.

184
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,270
This bastard! He called me shrimp!

185
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,360
{\an8}Hey, Bobby, am I a shrimp?! Huh?!

186
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:23,070
{\fad(500,550)}From the Mogaro Kingdom
Assassins - The Funk Brothers

187
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,750
{\an8}No, you're not! You're a big man!

188
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
Say something, you octopus!

189
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,510
Brother! That's enough!

190
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,250
I restrained the wrong person.

191
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:38,880
{\an8}If I ever hear you say it again, I'll gouge your eyes out!

192
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,870
{\fad(500,0)}Older Brother
Kelly Funk

193
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,970
{\an8}Don't keep trying to stop me, Bobby!

194
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,740
{\fad(500,0)}Younger Brother
Bobby

195
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,740
{\an8}But this is a competition, brother.

196
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,670
The Funk Brothers are so brutal!

197
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:54,510
They're assassins who are well known in the underground community!

198
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,090
I heard they're very powerful fighters and they've even
killed some pirates worth over 100 million!

199
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,760
I don't care if it's a competition or not! I'm not short!

200
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,760
These guys are annoying.

201
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,660
He's just an untrained amateur boxer.

202
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,590
Let's see what you've got!

203
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,100
Hey, shrimp!

204
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,410
Brother!

205
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,560
What?!

206
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,010
How weak!

207
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,460
I mean, maybe the Happou Navy people are too strong!

208
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,640
What a disappointment!

209
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,830
You're not a powerful fighter at all, you idiot! You fool!

210
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,160
Gatz-</i>san</i>!

211
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,460
You're next, younger brother!

212
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,910
Wait! I won't fight.

213
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,550
I've never gotten into a fight in my entire life!

214
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,200
Go to hell!

215
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,210
He turned his back?! These brothers are the worst!

216
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,650
The axe broke!

217
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,620
The axe was even infused with Armament Haki!

218
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,540
How tough is his body?!

219
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,780
Brother.

220
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,730
T-That bastard called me a shrimp.

221
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,330
Just put it on already, Bobby!

222
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,160
What's going on?!

223
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,730
Boo!

224
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,210
Boo from the Flower Country is taking quite a beating!

225
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,200
He's already passed out!

226
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,730
Who's punching him?!
Is that the wimpy younger brother Bobby?!

227
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,080
Or the weak older brother Kelly?!

228
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,380
I guess that's the older one!

229
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,240
He got bigger and looks like a different man!

230
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,710
Who did you call shrimp? Try saying it this time,

231
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:01,250
I will chew a hole in your throat!

232
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,990
Wow! Lucy's helmet got knocked off!

233
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,660
Hey, give it back!

234
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,090
I heard this strange story, Lucy.

235
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,800
I heard a pirate who's worth 400 million named Straw Hat Luffy is...

236
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,430
secretly fighting in this competition.

237
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,560
Don Chinjao is charging at something!

238
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,550
Garp, watch me!

239
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,980
I'm going to kill your grandson!

240
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,360
Block C! There are approximately 40 contenders remaining!

241
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,890
It's narrowing down to the strongest!

242
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,330
Who's going to be the winner?!
